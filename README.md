# NaiveBayesAlgorithm
An implementation of naive bayes algorithm in python

Python pair programming exercise

For this pair programming exercise we will follow few principles:<br />
1). Boy scouts rule:<br />
Boy scout rule says that leave the ground better than you found it. So our software program here is the ground. 
Leave it in a better condition than you originally found it. A software program is never perfect in its lifetime!
Even  if a program executes, compiles and fulfils the required functionality doen't mean that the program is perfect.
So always some changes are possible. Try to do those small changes and make our software program more perfect! <br />
2). Avoid broken windows:<br /> 
As said in Broken window theory a building tends to become more messy and chaotic over the period of time even 
if there is a single broken window. The same thing happens with code. Over the time code tends to become more 
chaotic, atleast for our little pair programming exercises we should not have any broken code on github. Even if we see
a simple warning, try to get rid of that warning because this warning might be the cause of program's failure in the near future.
Simple rule: Only push code without any errros, any warnings on the github repository.
